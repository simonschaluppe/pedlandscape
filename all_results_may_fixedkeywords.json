        "description": "Positive Energy District (PED) is graded as an essential component towards climate neutrality and smart cities. The development of PED brings great needs in new processes and the related cooperation among stakeholders. This project (\u2018PED-ACT\u2019) aims to optimise the process iteratively of PED development for enhanced stakeholder cooperation and reinforced decision-making.\nPED-ACT extracts the main characterization of PEDs automatically by machine learning approaches, through standardisation of the common database for existing PEDs, by focusing on Sweden, Turkey, and Austria. The digital PED references are then generated, based on a multi-criteria characterization matrix, by auto-matching the development needs/priorities from different stakeholders during bilateral learning and co-design processes among four specific cities (Borl\u00e4nge, Umea, Karsiyaka-Izmir, Ankara) and a county (Lower Austria). PED-ACT finally evaluates the feasibility of these digital PED references to further develop the replication/upscaling plans, towards \u2018climate-neutrality and smart cities\u2019 goals.\nPED-ACT deeply learns a wealth of information from the existing PEDs and then maps the practical needs for PED development in local contexts iteratively. It leads to concrete cooperation from the outset with support of data and involvement of stakeholders. The project results will reinforce decision-making of PEDs and support public administrators/local stakeholders in the new pathways and development.",

Including new innovative components into PEDs enables resilient energy supply to the system of urban systems, including urban-rural\nrelationships and transports within this system, by developing ethic Business Models based on circularity of resources and social innovation. The innovative edge is the inclusion of innovative PED components and improving possibilities for off-grid operation to increase the robustness and viability of PEDs, utilizing viable Business Models and innovative types of energy carriers via recycling of energy in the food-feed system, biogas and including transports in the PED system of systems. The innovative components that are included into PEDs are other types of energy carriers, via the food system of an urban system, while providing ecosystem services (e.g. closing nutrient cycles ensuring food security, mitigating climate change), improving the liveability in urban areas, and harmonize the urban-rural relationship in Sweden, Turkey and Italy.",

However, PEDs are often introverted islands in cities and the challenge is how to integrate them into their existing contexts creating climate-neutral, resilient and liveable neighbourhoods. Visions, plans, projects, and solutions for PEDs exist, but defining concrete, innovative, inclusive, and shared co-designed strategies for existing urban structures and societies, implementing and replicating them, remains in many cases the next urgent task.\nBuilding on the results of TRANS-PED, the aim of PED4ALL is to develop feasible, operative, implementable and inclusive strategies that can be adopted by PED and neighbourhood stakeholders to realise a deep energy transition and holistic changes to cities. This three-year project will engage an action-oriented network of PED and neighbourhood stakeholders in Belgium, Italy, and Turkey to apply a shared co-productive methodology to define a set of energy, policy and regulatory, governance and social, spatial, and design strategies for urban transition and innovation, to test and replicate them. The project partners will engage in a series of online and in-person activities to co-produce a range of practical tools to build a community of practice and position Europe as a global role model for urban energy transformations.",

The Cities4PEDs project has investigated the framework conditions for developing PEDs in three cities, Brussels, Stockholm and Vienna and further interesting PED-relevant projects across Europe.  Twenty-five PED-relevant projects were identified by the consortium for further investigation. Out of this list, seven projects were selected for in-depth interviews based on their holistic approach to sustainability at large but in particular, their relevance from a PED perspective. The investigations have been analysed and a multidisciplinary overview of the different aspects of concern for the realization of PEDs has been developed. This PED Atlas is a documentation of the process, the known framework conditions and PED elements.",
