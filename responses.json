The integrated energy concepts become more complex: In the future, various renewable energy systems situated in the neighbourhood will cover the energy demand for buildings, mobility and supply\/disposal to bring forward a positive energy balance.\r\n\r\nWe see from existing PED project that there is a need for a trusted intermediary for urban area development to balance the interests of different stakeholders. A central, digital energy model of the buildings and the energy system provides the necessary support for trusted intermediaries to be able to cover the requirements of the different process steps. The project develops Quality Assurance method for PEDs by applying Digital Twin models from early design phases onwards. In several stages of PED processes the digital energy model should support QA to realise planned energy performance in the operation phase of urban districts.\r\n\r\nThis Digital Twin QA concept will be tested and analysed in 3 different living labs in every participating country. By designing a business model for Digital Twins for PEDs and disseminating the experiences and concepts, this approach is also to be used for other neighbourhood projects.","ECONOMIC Keywords    [Market]":"N\/A","ECONOMIC Keywords    [Financial Strategies]":"N\/A","ECONOMIC Keywords    [Circular Economy]":"N\/A","ECONOMIC Keywords    [Cost Analysis]":"N\/A","ECONOMIC Keywords    [Affordability]":"N\/A","ECONOMIC Keywords    [Support and Information]":"N\/A","ECONOMIC Keywords    [Ownership Structures]":"N\/A","ECONOMIC Keywords    [Incentives]":"N\/A","ECONOMIC Keywords    [Business models]":"N\/A","LEGAL Keywords    [Multi-level Legislation]":"N\/A","LEGAL Keywords    [Urban Landuse ]":"N\/A","LEGAL Keywords    [District Regulation]":"N\/A","LEGAL Keywords    [Participative Instruments]":"N\/A","LEGAL Keywords    [Energy Communities]":"N\/A","LEGAL Keywords    [Energy market structures]":"N\/A","LEGAL Keywords    [Innovative Institutional Change]":"N\/A","SOCIAL Keywords    [Community Engagement]":"N\/A","SOCIAL Keywords    [Narrative&amp;
