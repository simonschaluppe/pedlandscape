INTERACT boosts the emergence of Energy Communities as one crucial building block to achieve Positive Energy Districts. The project will design an optimal organization and structure for Energy Communities based on:

a. success-factors from a competence-network of existing PED/PEN approaches,
b. stakeholder needs and motivation,
c. the available technologies, and
d. a holistic architecture.

The project will develop a roadmap for the Energy Community’s secure and reliable embedding into the power system structure, focusing on two pilot regions in Sweden and Austria.

INTERACT is supported by the Austrian Ministry of Climate Action, Environment, Energy, Mobility, Innovation, and Technology (BMK), Technology Agency of the Czech Republic (TAČR) and Swedish Energy Agency / Viable Cities, Sweden. It has received funding in the framework of the PED Programme, which is implemented by the Joint Programming Initiative Urban Europe and SET Plan Action 3.2.

The project has been selected for funding in Positive Energy Districts (PEDs) pilot call JPI Urban Europe and is planned for 24 months with start in February 2021.","Yes","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","Yes","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","Yes","N/A","N/A","Yes","N/A","N/A","N/A","Yes","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","Yes","N/A","N/A","N/A","Yes","N/A","","","","D

On the example of four focus districts from different European Countries we will establish and test strategies how to tackle the necessary energy transition. We will analyze different areas which were selected as important by the focus districts:

·       Photo voltaic solar panels (PV) maximization,

·       integration of electric vehicles in mobility concepts and usage as energy storage,

·       usage patterns to increase energy efficiency and

·       common climate and energy action plans.

Based on a common Positive energy district definition framework for existing urban districts we will show how to best monitor and visualize achieved results. Fitting participation concepts shall ensure active stakeholder participation and motivate further cities to join the pathway towards reaching 1000s of Positive Energy Districts and Positive Energy Neighborhoods all over Europe.","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","Yes","Yes","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","Yes","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","Yes","N/A","Yes","N/A","N/A","N/A","SECAP","","","D3.1 Framework definition status and Methodology description for SimplyPositive","http://simplypositive.eu/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/D3.1-Framework-definition-status-and-Methodology-description-for-SimplyPositive-vfinal.pdf","","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","Yes","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","Assessment","","","D4.1 Geospatial map and report on georeferenced multi-layer mapping of the PV potential on the example of Focus District of Amsterdam","http://simplypositive.eu/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/D4.1_Geospatial-map-and-report-on-geo-referenced-multi-layer-mapping-of-the-PV-potential-on-the-example-of-Focus-District-of-Amsterdam-vfinal.pdf","","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","Yes","N/A","N/A","N/A","Yes","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","Yes","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","","","","D4.2 Report on urban policy suggestions regarding automated choice of installation modes and expansion to various panels dimensions","http://simplypositive.eu/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/D4.2-Report-on-Urban-Policy-Suggestions-vfinal.pdf","","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","Yes","Yes","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","Yes","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","","","","D4.3.

The Cities4PEDs project has investigated the framework conditions for developing PEDs in three cities, Brussels, Stockholm and Vienna and further interesting PED-relevant projects across Europe.  Twenty-five PED-relevant projects were identified by the consortium for further investigation. Out of this list, seven projects were selected for in-depth interviews based on their holistic approach to sustainability at large but in particular, their relevance from a PED perspective. The investigations have been analysed and a multidisciplinary overview of the different aspects of concern for the realization of PEDs has been developed. This PED Atlas is a documentation of the process, the known framework conditions and PED elements.","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","Yes","N/A","Yes","Yes","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","Yes","Yes","N/A","N/A","N/A","Yes","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","Yes","N/A","Yes","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","","","","Enabling PEDs through city instruments","https://energy-cities.eu/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Cities4PEDs-WP3-FINAL.pdf","","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","Yes","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","Yes","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","Yes","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","","","","Towards co-ownership and inclusive PED development","https://energy-cities.eu/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Cities4PEDs-WP4-FINAL.pdf","","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","Yes","Yes","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","Yes","Yes","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","Yes","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","","","","Monitoring Framework","https://energy-cities.eu/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Cities4PEDs-WP6-Monitoring_FINAL_WithCover-1.pdf","","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","Yes","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","","","","","","","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","","","","","","","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","","","","","","","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","","","","","","","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","","","","","","","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","","",""

in the energy transition, but implementing them is difficult because of organisational, regulatory and planning 
issues. FLEXPOSTS aims to improve the implementation process of PEDs, focusing on flexible energy assets. This 
integrates PEDs into urban planning and energy system planning. Organisational structures are developed and 
assessed, providing decision-makers the toolkit for implementation. FLEXPOSTS puts findings into practice in two 
demonstration districts in Leeuwarden (NL) and Aalborg (DK), establishing a PED network with relevant

The integrated energy concepts become more complex: In the future, various renewable energy systems situated in the neighbourhood will cover the energy demand for buildings, mobility and supply/disposal to bring forward a positive energy balance.

We see from existing PED project that there is a need for a trusted intermediary for urban area development to balance the interests of different stakeholders. A central, digital energy model of the buildings and the energy system provides the necessary support for trusted intermediaries to be able to cover the requirements of the different process steps. The project develops Quality Assurance method for PEDs by applying Digital Twin models from early design phases onwards. In several stages of PED processes the digital energy model should support QA to realise planned energy performance in the operation phase of urban districts.

This Digital Twin QA concept will be tested and analysed in 3 different living labs in every participating country. By designing a business model for Digital Twins for PEDs and disseminating the experiences and concepts, this approach is also to be used for other neighbourhood projects.","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","Yes","N/A","Yes","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","Yes","N/A","N/A","Yes","Yes","N/A","Yes","Yes","N/A","N/A","N/A","Yes","Yes","N/A","Yes","N/A","N/A","N/A","Yes","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","Yes","Yes","Yes","N/A","N/A","N/A","","","","Digital Twin Quality Assurance process for PEDs ","https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1755-1315/1363/1/012085","","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","Yes","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","Yes","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","Yes","N/A","Yes","Yes","N/A","N/A","Yes","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","Yes","N/A","Yes","N/A","N/A","N/A","PED process","PED defintion","","","","","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","","","","","","","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","","","","","","","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","","","","","","","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","","","","","","","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","","","","","","","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","","","","","","","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","","","","","","","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","","","","","","","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","","",""
